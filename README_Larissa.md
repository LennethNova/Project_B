# Project_B

## Part I
### Activities for this:
- 28/10/21: Look for scientific papers related to the stock market models. Several webpages showed good information and also one paper that looks interesting was found. Went to Udemy in order to study some courses that will help to explain about the topic.
- 29/10/21: Redact part of the first part for the presentation in order for the team to review. This will be first make using Word and then upload it to google drive with a backup.

The draft was:
# Draft:
## Topic
Using Yahoo Finance and the code obtained from the Towards Data Science webpage (https://towardsdatascience.com/downloading-historical-stock-prices-in-python-93f85f059c1f) in order to scrape the information containing the stock data (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume, Name), the topic that will be covered is to create a portfolio in order to suggest the companies to invest. By working on the data, the target is to create a model that helps predict possible ups and downs in the market using the historical stock prices.
The main reason to select this topic is that this data is real and will be of great use to polish skills and make something that will be useful for someone that wants to invert in the stock market.
Using a time series model and machine learning models, specially Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks, the data will be tested and trained to try to accomplish a good percent of accuracy. For this, the data that will be used are samples taken in regular time intervals, with pandas, numpy and matplotlib, the time behavior can be observed. Also, it is important to note that Keras will be used and, a deeper research on exponential smoothing will be made.
 
## Communication protocols
To communicate with the team members, the next platforms will be used:
-          **Slack:** There was a new workspace created in order to keep in touch with all the team members.
-          **Zoom:** Using the time during the bootcamp and office hours in order to keep working on the project. Also, there is the possibility to use it outside the bootcamp class or office hours.
-          **Google Meet:** In case there is a need to discuss any topic related to the challenge, and there is no way to access Zoom, this will be another way to contact each team member.
 
## Github
A Github was created with the name of Project_B (https://github.com/LennethNova/Project_B) and each team member has a branch with their respective name in order to control the way the data will be uploaded.
 
## Machine Learning Model
For this data, different models will be used to test the accuracy. As previously mentioned in the *Topic* section, SVM, ANN and other models will be used to train and test the data. Libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib will also be considered in this point, but the analysis will not be exclusive to the use of those since some others will be needed in order to accomplish the project.
The challenge is to get the best accuracy possible for the models and to make a good use of the code to get the expected results to make an accurate portfolio of the suggested investments.
 
## Database
The dataset, as mentioned previously in the *Topic* section has the next content:
-          Stock symbol
-          Date
-          Open
-          High
-          Low
-          Closing
-          Adjusting Closing price
-          Volume traded
 
## Dashboard
For now, the dashboard will not be shown since the data needs to be complete in order to start visualizing the results.

- 30/10/21: Read some papers and update the principal readme file while making this journal for the activities that every day I will make. Review Udemy courses. Check with my tutor some topics and some questions that could be considered for the project. Research on previous models in order to know how to use the ARIMA model.
